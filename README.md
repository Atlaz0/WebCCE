# WebCCE

> **Status:** The project is **not finished** and still needs refining.

WebCCE is an **online collaborative web editor** that lets you write, preview, and share code in real time.  
Its clean interface and live preview make it easy for teams or friends to experiment together right in the browser.

## Features

- **Real-time collaboration** – Multiple users can edit the same file simultaneously.  
- **Live code preview** – See changes instantly as you type.  
- **Browser-based** – No installation or setup required.  
- **Intuitive interface** – Simple, clean, and easy to navigate.  

## Quick Start

1. Go to [mp2upnhs.my](https://mp2upnhs.my).  
2. The backend is ready when [api.mp2upnhs.my](https://api.mp2upnhs.my) returns a **404** (expected—no handler is set up).  
   - If you see a *Render spinning up* message instead, the backend is still starting.  
3. Select a file and start typing. Changes appear instantly for everyone connected.

No installation, no setup, and no special requirements.

## Contributing

Contributions of any kind are welcome—as long as the project keeps the **WebCCE** name and stays true to the core idea of an intuitive, collaborative web editor.
